- Python library
- used for working with arrays
- short for "Numerical Python"
- has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices
- NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists
- The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy
- NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
- This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.

#Example - Checking NumPy Version
import numpy as np

print(np.__version__)
