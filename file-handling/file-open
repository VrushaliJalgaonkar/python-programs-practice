open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.

There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:
"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist

"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist

"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

"t" - Text - Default value. Text mode

"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)

#Example - 1 : open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file:
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.read())

#Example - 2 : By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return:
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.read(5))

#Example - 3 : Read lines :
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
for x in f:
  print(x)

#Example - 4 : CLose file :
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())
f.close()
