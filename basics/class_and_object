# Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created
# The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.
# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

# It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class

Example-1 of Class, Object, __int()__() and __str__() :

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"

p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1)
